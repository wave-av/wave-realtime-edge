/**
 * E-EGRESS-ROUTER ARM SLICE (#75) — the routed-egress `MediaConsumer` factory.
 *
 * The egress-router (#75 P1) decides WHERE a job goes; P2/P3/P4 (egress-wave-render.ts /
 * egress-runpod-nvenc.ts / egress-cf-stream-passthrough.ts) are the per-tier backends, each unit-testable
 * behind an injected client. What none of them do yet is attach to a ROOM's live `MediaTap` (#74) as a single
 * routed consumer driven by ONE decided job — that is this module's job: given an `EgressJob`, build the ONE
 * `MediaConsumer` a RoomDO registers, so a tapped frame flows straight to the decided backend's HTTP endpoint.
 *
 * INERT BY DESIGN (integration-arming plan, Task 7 — "ADDING inert code, not arming"). `onFrame` is a no-op
 * unless BOTH `EGRESS_ROUTER_ENABLED` and `MEDIA_TAP_ENABLED` read armed (`routedEgressArmed`, mirroring the
 * strict true/"1"/"true" predicates `egressRouterEnabled`/`mediaTapEnabled` already use) — so merely
 * constructing/wiring this consumer does not change prod behavior; both ◆ flag flips (Tasks 3 pre-req via
 * MEDIA_TAP_ENABLED, and Task 8 via EGRESS_ROUTER_ENABLED) are needed before a single fetch call fires.
 *
 * WHY ONLY waveRender/runpodNvenc CONSUME FRAMES. `cfStream` passthrough (egress-cf-stream-passthrough.ts) is
 * a ONE-SHOT PROVISIONER — it hands the SFU track straight to CF Stream and never touches per-frame bytes
 * (see that module's docstring: "this backend is a one-shot PROVISIONER — NOT a MediaConsumer"). So when the
 * router decides `cfStream`, this consumer's `onFrame` intentionally stays a no-op (deferred to whatever calls
 * `CfStreamPassthroughEgressBackend.provision` directly) rather than fabricating a per-frame POST to a backend
 * that was never designed to receive one.
 *
 * INJECTED FETCH. The only I/O is behind the injected `fetchFn` parameter (defaults to nothing — the caller
 * MUST supply one), so this module ships zero unverified wire code and is fully unit-testable with a fake.
 * The endpoint URL/auth-header shape here is the SAME `WAVE_RENDER_URL`+bearer / `RUNPOD_NVENC_ENDPOINT`+bearer
 * config surface the P2/P3 backend Env interfaces already declare (`EgressWaveRenderEnv`,
 * `EgressRunpodNvencEnv`) — reused, not reinvented.
 *
 * ROOMDO WIRING — NOT DONE HERE, FLAGGED FOR REVIEW. Unlike the agent media-read fold (`agent-media-consumer.ts`
 * → `RoomDO.armAgentRead`, invoked from the existing `agent-bind` intent), room.ts has NO existing egress seam
 * at all: grepping room.ts/room-recording.ts/whip-room.ts for "egress" returns nothing. There is no no-op
 * egress branch to flip on, and no existing intent (like `agent-bind`) that names WHEN a room should start
 * routed egress. Inventing a new RoomDO intent + worker route to call this factory would be guessing at
 * production control-plane shape rather than encoding an existing decision — exactly what the plan says not to
 * do ("if you can't safely locate the RoomDO seam ... REPORT the wiring point as needing review rather than
 * guessing"). This factory is therefore shipped standalone + fully tested; the RoomDO call site (mirroring
 * `armAgentRead`'s pattern: a method that builds this consumer, subscribes it via `mediaTap.subscribe`, and
 * drains it via `pumpConsumer`) is the concrete next step and needs Jake to name what triggers it.
